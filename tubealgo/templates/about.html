            <h1>About TubeAlgo</h1>
            <p class="lead">Empowering every YouTube creator with the data and AI-driven insights they need to grow their channel smarter, not just harder.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>TubeAlgo was born from a simple observation: countless talented creators struggle to understand the complexities of the YouTube algorithm. We saw a need for a tool that was not only powerful but also intuitive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their analytics expertise. We are a team of developers, data scientists, and content creators ourselves, dedicated to demystifying YouTube growth.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Our platform is a suite of tools designed to support you at every stage of your creative journey. We provide:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-Channel Competitor Tracking:</strong> Go beyond your own analytics. TubeAlgo allows you to track and analyze the strategies of any public YouTube channel, providing insights into upload schedules, top-performing content, and keyword usage that are not available within YouTube Studio.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Co-Pilot for Content Strategy:</strong> Leverage our AI, powered by Google Gemini, to generate data-driven content ideas, viral titles, and optimized descriptions based on real-time trends and competitor performanceâ€”a feature designed to give you a creative edge.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated Real-Time Alerts:</strong> Stay ahead of the competition with integrated Telegram notifications. Get immediate alerts for new competitor videos, allowing you to react quickly to emerging trends in your niche.</li>
                <li><strong>Unified Channel Management:</strong> Streamline your workflow by managing your videos, playlists, and uploads directly through the TubeAlgo interface, consolidating tasks that would otherwise require navigating multiple sections of YouTube Studio.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Who We Are For</h2>
            <p>Whether you're just starting out and looking for your first 1,000 subscribers, or you're an established creator aiming to optimize your content strategy, TubeAlgo is built for you. Our mission is to level the playing field, giving every creator the chance to succeed.</p>
