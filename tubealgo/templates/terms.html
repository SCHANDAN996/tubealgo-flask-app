            <p>Welcome to TubeAlgo ("we", "us", "our"). By accessing or using our website and services (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.</p>

            <h2>1. YouTube Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Our Service utilizes YouTube API Services to provide its features. By using TubeAlgo, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
            <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal at any time through your account settings.</p>
            <p>All payments are processed through a third-party payment gateway. For details on refunds, please review our <a href="{{ url_for('core.refund_policy') }}">Refund Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>4. Prohibited Activities</h2>

                <li>Use any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</li>
                <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise discover the source code of the Service.</li>
            </ul>
