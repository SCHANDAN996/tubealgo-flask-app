            <h2>Data Calculation and Metrics</h2>
            <p>To provide you with insights, we calculate certain metrics based on the data we receive from third-party APIs. Here is an overview of our calculation methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Views per Day:</strong> This is calculated by dividing a video's total views by the number of days since its publication. Formula: <code>Total Views / Days Since Upload</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement Rate:</strong> This is an estimated percentage. Formula: <code>((Likes + Comments) / Views) * 100</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Comment Sentiment:</strong> We use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library to analyze comment text and determine if it is positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These metrics are estimations designed to provide trends and insights, not guaranteed facts.</p>
